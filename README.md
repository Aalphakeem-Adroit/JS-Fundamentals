# JavaScript Fundamentals Project

## üìå Description
This project introduces the **fundamentals of JavaScript**, one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages. The focus is on using JavaScript for **scripting** (like Python) and **web front-end development**. Through this project, learners gain hands-on experience with core JavaScript concepts.
